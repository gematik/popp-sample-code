# PoPP Sample Implementation

## Overview

This project provides a sample implementation of the PoPP-Service and
PoPP-Client according to [gemSpec_PoPP_Service](https://gemspec.gematik.de/prereleases/Draft_PoPP_25_1/gemSpec_PoPP_Service_V1.0.0_CC2).
The [eGK-Hash-Datenbank](https://gemspec.gematik.de/prereleases/Draft_PoPP_25_1/gemSpec_PoPP_Service_V1.0.0_CC2/#6.2.1.9) is implemented as PostgresSQL database.

You can run the components either locally or via Docker.

## Building and running the project locally

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Java JDK/JRE 21**
- **Docker**
- **eGK Testkarten** [if you need some, go to gematik Onlineshop](https://fachportal.gematik.de/gematik-onlineshop/testkarten?ai%5Baction%5D=detail&ai%5Bcontroller%5D=Catalog&ai%5Bd_name%5D=testkarte-egk-g2&ai%5Bd_pos%5D=1)  
- **Standard-Kartenleser** (PC/SC via USB) or
- **Konnektor and eHealth Kartenterminal**

> All keys and p12 stores contained in this repository are intentionally published to allow the project to run out of the box after cloning.

*Notes*

- Ensure ports '8081' (PoPP-Client), `5432` (eGK-Hash-Datenbank) and `8443` (PoPP-Service) are free.
- You can modify `docker-compose.yml` to fit your environment.

## Step-by-step guide

### Build

```bash
  ./mvnw clean install
```

Optionally without tests:

```bash
  ./mvnw clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

### Configuration

All described configuration options must be implemented in the `application-dev.yaml` of the PoPP-Client.

#### a) Standard-Kartenleser

"Standard-Kartenleser" is a PC/SC card reader, which is typically connected via USB.

By default, the PoPP-Client uses the first Standard-Kartenleser it detects. However, you can specify explicitly which Standard-Kartenleser to use.

```yaml
cardreader:
      name: "<card reader name>"
```

The name is case-sensitive but does not have to be complete, for example with "REINER SCT" the
Standard-Kartenleser named "REINER SCT cyberJack RFID standard 1" will be found.

#### b) Konnektor

**Optional: Certificates for TLS**

The PoPP-Client supports TLS connections using [ECC](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemILF/gemILF_PS/latest/#A_17094-01) for communication with your Konnektor. To enable and configure this, follow the steps below:

1. Enable TLS by setting:

   ```yml
   connector:
     secure:
       enable: true
   ```
* If your Konnektor does not have a resolvable domain name, disable hostname validation:
  
  ```yml
  connector:
    secure:
      hostname-validation: false
  ```
  
* Upload your client certificate (e.g., `keystore.p12`) to the Konnektor client configuration.
* Retrieve the Konnektor certificate (replace `<KONNEKTOR_IP>` and `<PORT>` with your specific Konnektor address):

  ```
  openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <Konnektor_IP>:<PORT>
  ```

* Import the Konnektor certificate including the whole trust chain into your truststore (e.g., truststore.p12):

  ```
  keytool -import -alias connector-server -file server-cert.pem -keystore truststore.p12
  ```
  
* Note: The `connector.secure.keystore`, `connector.secure.truststore`, and their respective passwords are used only
  for communication with the Konnektor. This is distinct from the TLS configuration used for communication with 
  the PoPP server.

**Address and context**

Configure your Konnektor address and context:

```yaml
connector:
  end-point-url: <ip address and port of event-service endpoint of Konnektor>
  terminal-configuration:
  secure:
    enable: <If TLS should be used>
    hostname-validation: <The Hostname of the Konnektor should be validated>
    keystore: <Keystore with the client certificate>
    keystore-password: <Password of the keystore>
    truststore: <Truststore with the Konnektor certificate and its trust chain>
    truststore-password: <Password of the truststore>
  context:
    clientSystemId: <ClientSystemId for Konnektor Context>
    workplaceId: <WorkplaceId for Konnektor Context>
    mandantId: <MandantId for Konnektor Context>
  soap-services:
    get-cards: <GetCards soap service endpoint>
    start-card-session: <StartCardSession soap service endpoint>
    stop-card-session: <StopCardSession soap service endpoint>
    secure-send-apdu: <SecureSendApdu soap service endpoint>
```
Example:

```yaml
connector:
  end-point-url: "http://127.0.0.1"
  terminal-configuration:
  secure:
    enable: false
    hostname-validation: true
    keystore: keystore.p12
    keystore-password: changeit
    truststore: truststore.p12
    truststore-password: changeit
  context:
    clientSystemId: "ClientID1"
    workplaceId: "Workplace1"
    mandantId: "Mandant1"
  soap-services:
    get-cards: "http://ws.gematik.de/conn/EventService/v7.2#GetCards"
    start-card-session: "http://ws.gematik.de/conn/CardService/v8.2#StartCardSession"
    stop-card-session: "http://ws.gematik.de/conn/CardService/v8.2#StopCardSession"
    secure-send-apdu: "http://ws.gematik.de/conn/CardService/v8.2#SecureSendAPDU"
```

**Supported Konnektor functions**

- `StartCardSession` - see [StardCardSession in gemSpec_Kon](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Kon/latest/#4.1.5.5.7)
- `SecureSendApdu`   - see [SecureSendApdu in gemSpec_Kon](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Kon/latest/#4.1.5.5.8)
- `StopCardSession`  - see [StopCardSession in gemSpec_Kon](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Kon/latest/#4.1.5.5.9)
- `GetCards`         - see [GetCards in gemSpec_Kon](https://gemspec.gematik.de/docs/gemSpec/gemSpec_Kon/latest/#4.1.6.5.2)
        -- If GetCards finds more than one eGK the first one is used.

## Execution

### Start the eGK-Hash-Datenbank

Before running the PoPP-Service, you need to start the eGK-Hash-Datenbank.

```bash
  cd popp-server/docker && docker compose --file postgres-dev.yaml up
```

For powershell use:

```bash
  cd popp-server/docker; docker compose --file postgres-dev.yaml up
```

To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:

```bash
  cd docker && docker compose down
```

For powershell use:

```bash
  cd docker; docker compose down)
```

### Start the PoPP-Service

```bash
  ./mvnw -pl popp-server spring-boot:run
```

### Start the PoPP-Client

```bash
  ./mvnw -pl popp-client spring-boot:run
```

For Linux with additional argument:

```bash
  ./mvnw -pl popp-client spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dsun.security.smartcardio.library=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcsclite.so.1"
```

#### Alternatively: Docker usage (Service & Database)

```bash
  cd docker && docker compose up
```

The client must be started locally!

### Executing the tests

To execute the tests for the whole project, run the following command:

```bash
  ./mvnw clean test
```

To execute also the integration tests, run the following command:

```bash
  ./mvnw clean verify
```

To execute the tests for a specific module, use the `-pl` option to specify the module name. For example, to run the tests for the `popp-client` module, run:

```bash
  ./mvnw -pl popp-client clean test
```

## Generate a PoPP-Token

The client provides the following endpoint to generate a PoPP-Token:

`http://localhost:8081/token/{communication-type}?clientsessionid={client-session-id} `

The request parameter `clientsessionid` is optional. If set, the `clientsessionid` will overwrite the Konnektor `clientsessionid` from `StartCardSession`

The communication type must be one of the following:

- `contact-standard`
  - use contact-based interface from Standard-Kartenleser
- `contactless-standard`
  - use contactless interface from Standard-Kartenleser
- `contact-connector`
  - use contact-based interface from eHealth-Kartenterminal via Konnektor
  - *Note: if the client was started with mock configuration (see above) the scenario is simulated without any terminal and just with static APDUs*
- `contactless-connector`
  - use contactless interface from eHealth-Kartenterminal via Konnektor
- `contact-connector-via-standard-terminal`
  - generate sample messages for Konnektor via contact-based interface from Standard-Kartenleser

### Example usage

To generate a PoPP-Token with `contact-standard` option, open the following URL in your browser:
[http://localhost:8081/token/contact-standard](http://localhost:8081/token/contact-standard)

Alternatively, you can use this `curl` command in the terminal:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:8081/token/contact-standard
```

To view the generated PoPP-Token, check the console output of the client. 

For PoPP-Token claims see [api-popp](https://github.com/gematik/api-popp/blob/main/src/openapi/I_PoPP_Token_Generation.yaml).
