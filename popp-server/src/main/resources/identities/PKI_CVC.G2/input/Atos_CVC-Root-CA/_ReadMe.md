# Introduction

This directory contains manually downloaded certificates from the
[Atos web side][Atos].

It is possible that different certificates share the same file name on the
[Atos web side][Atos].
In that case during the download or moving process the file name is "incremented".
E.g., if a file with name "DEGXX870222_cross.cvc" is already present, then the
file name for the new content is changed to "DEGXX870222_cross (1).cvc".
